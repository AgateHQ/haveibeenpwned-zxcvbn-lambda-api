# haveibeenpwned-zxcvbn-lambda-api
Here's a chance to have your very own serverless API endpoint up on AWS Lambda so you can score new user passwords with the Dropbox's fantastic `zxcvbn` library _AND_ check their password against Troy Hunt's [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) database via his APIv2 Range Query endpoint.

![API in Action](.github/pwnage.gif?raw=true "API in Action")

_**NOTE**: this is for the BACKEND API only - how to handle the response client-side is your own monster to slay :dragon_face:_

## Lazy quick-start
1. Create an AWS profile with IAM full access, Lambda full access and API Gateway Administrator privileges.
2. Add the keys to your ~/.aws/credentials file:
    ```
    [pwnage]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET
    ```
3. Rename `example.env.json` to `env.json` and change the values to whatever suits your fancy.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. Launch ðŸš€ with `npm run deploy`
6. Change whatever you need to change in the AWS API Gateway to make this work with your own application.
7. Update the Lambda API with any changes you make to the source by running `npm run update`

This uses the cool-as-a-cucumber [claudia.js](https://claudiajs.com/documentation.html) for handling AWS deployment - please refer to the claudia.js docs to learn more about this voodoo.

## How to Use
### Request
POST the input **over HTTPS** as JSON using the field `password` like so:
```
{
  "password": "monkey123"
}
```
### Response
The API will respond with `ok` indicating successful scoring and range-query, a `score` of 0 through 4 per `zxcvbn`, and `pwned` indicating the number times the input appears in the `haveibeenpwned` database. Note that if `pwned` is greater than 0, `score` will always be 0.
```
{
    "ok": true,
    "score": 0,
    "pwned": 56491
}
```
### Good to Know
The health-check endpoint `/_up` is included by default; this also serves as a handy means to warm-up a Lambda function container before your users start feeding you input.

### Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with Amazon, Troy Hunt, Dropbox, haveibeenpwned or any combination thereof. People just seemed to think that this was neat, and this was the easiest way I could come up with to share it.

Handling user passwords is no laughing matter, so handle them with care and respect.

That being said: just like your users, assume that I have no idea what I'm doing - REVIEW THE SOURCE, and use this at your own risk!
